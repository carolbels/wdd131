Images
An image with fixed dimensions causes the page to scroll if it's larger than the viewport. 
We recommend giving all images a max-width of 100%, which shrinks images to fit the available space while preventing them from stretching beyond their initial size.

In most cases, you can do this by adding the following to your style sheet:
*/

img {
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
}

/* 
Add the dimensions of the image to the img element
Even when you set max-width: 100%, we still recommend adding width and height attributes to your <img> tags 
so the browser can reserve space for images before they load. This helps prevent layout shifts.
