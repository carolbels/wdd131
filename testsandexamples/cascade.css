/* Order of CSS rules can affect the result due to the cascade 
and specificity principles in CSS.
Here are key factors to consider about order in CSS:

Cascade and Specificity: If multiple CSS rules target the same element, 
the order and specificity of the rules determine which styles are applied. 
CSS rules that appear later in the code will override earlier ones if they 
have the same specificity. However, if a later rule is less specific, 
it won't override a more specific earlier rule.

Inheritance and Initial Values: The order matters when properties are 
set in a parent element and expected to inherit to child elements. 
If you redefine an inherited property later in the code for a specific 
child element, that change will override the parent's inherited style.

Order of Shorthand Properties: Within a single CSS rule, if you list 
conflicting shorthand properties (like margin and margin-top), 
the order matters. Later properties in the same rule will override 
previous ones.


This rule will be overridden by the next one */
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}

h1 {
    color: red; /* This will apply since it comes after the previous rule */
    font-size: 24px;
}
 /*In the example above, the h1 element will be red because the 
 second color property overwrites the first one.
So while CSS is flexible, the order can be crucial in getting 
the intended styling, especially when working with multiple styles 
targeting the same elements.*/
