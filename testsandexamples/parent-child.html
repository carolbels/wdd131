<!-- In HTML and CSS, parent and child elements describe the relationship 
 between elements within the structure of a webpage.

Parent Element
A parent element is an HTML tag that contains other elements inside it. 
Think of it as a container or holder for other elements.

Child Element
A child element is an HTML tag that is nested inside another element. 
The child element is "inside" or "contained" by the parent. -->


<div class="parent">
    <p class="child">This is a child element.</p>
</div>

<!--In this example:

The <div> with the class parent is the parent element.
The <p> with the class child is the child element of the <div>.-->
