a responsive site might show content in a single-column view on a phone, two columns on a tablet, and three or four columns on a desktop computer.
Because internet-capable devices have so many possible screen sizes, it's important for your site to adapt to any existing or future screen size. 
Modern responsive design also accounts for modes of interaction such as touch screens. The goal is to optimize the experience for everyone.

SET THE VIEWPORT

Pages optimized for a variety of devices must include a meta viewport tag in the head of the document. 
This tag tells the browser how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

To try to provide the best experience, mobile browsers render the page at a desktop screen width (usually about 980px, 
though this varies across devices), and then try to make the content look better by increasing font sizes and scaling the content to fit the screen. 
This can make fonts look inconsistent and require users to zoom in to see and interact with the content.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    …
    <!--Using the meta viewport value width=device-width tells the page to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels (DIP), 
    a standard visual pixel unit (which can be made up of many physical pixels on a high-density screen). 
    This lets the page reflow content to match different screen sizes.-->
    
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!--Some browsers keep the page's width constant when rotating to landscape mode, and zoom to fill the screen instead of reflowing. 
    Adding the value initial-scale=1 tells browsers to set a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels regardless of device orientation, 
    letting the page take advantage of the full landscape width.-->
    …
  </head>

  <!--Caution: To ensure that older browsers can properly parse the attributes, use a comma to separate attributes.
  
  Caution: In addition to initial-scale, the minimum-scale, maximum-scale, and user-scalable attributes are also available. 
  We don't recommend using these attributes because they can prevent the user from zooming the viewport, potentially causing accessibility issues.
