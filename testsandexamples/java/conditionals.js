// Conditional Statements:
// if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

if (condition) {
// Code to execute if the condition is true
}

// The condition is evaluated to a boolean value, i.e., true or false. 
// Writing condition statements is a critical skill in programming. 
// The use of operators and expressions is a key concept in writing condition statements that solve programming problems.

// else statement: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.
if (condition) {
// Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
// Code to execute if the condition is false
}

// else if statement: This structure allows for the checking of multiple conditions in sequence.
if (condition1) {
// Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
// Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
// Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
}
