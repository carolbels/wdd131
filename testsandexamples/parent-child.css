/*In CSS, you can style child elements based on their parent. 
For example:*/

.parent {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

.parent .child {
    color: red;
}

/*Here, the CSS styles:

The parent (.parent) background color will be light blue.
The child (.parent .child) text color will be red.
This structure lets you control how elements look based 
on where they appear in the HTML hierarchy.*/
