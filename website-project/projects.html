                <h2>Midpoint-Prediction-Tool</h2>
                <p>One of the processes that used to take a great deal of time daily from our work schedules in the Compensation team was pricing jobs whenever a manager, 
                    an HR Business Partner, or a Talent Acquisition partner logged a case to have a job activated for a new location (we're in many countries). The first time 
                    I priced a job I had to open several different Excel reports, filter to get the data I needed, populate a template, and then start thinking and making my pricing decisions. 
                    Each job would take us about 20 minutes and the reports were massive, which would add to the time while Excel would freeze multiple times during the process. 
                    I developed a tool using VBA, Python, and XML for the graphical user interface to automate this, and as a result, we have a more streamlined process 
                    that takes less than 2 minutes per job.</p>
